Systems level programming interfaces for modern C++ with portability.

Regularly tested on
* Linux
* Android
* Cygwin
Should work a wide variety of operating environments.

The name arose out of my mistaken belief in the existence of a phonetically
similar word, that I later discovered was "unison". That is, I believed that
"unisis" was a word meaning something like 'a coordination between many agents
without their prior spoken agreement to do so.' By replacing the later half
with 'sys' for the 'system' abbreviation I came up with the name of this code,
which is motivated in some sense by the philosophical equivalent of my
imaginary word's meaning.
