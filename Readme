There is no library, but to build the unit tests you can simply type 'make'
or 'nmake' depending on your environment. The authored Makefile has been
written to work for both without change.

Name
====
The name arose out of my mistaken belief in the existence of a phonetically
similar word, which I later discovered was "unison". That is, I believed that
"unisis" was word meaning something like 'a coordination between parts so that
they fulfill a purpose together which they could not have done alone.' The way
I feel when this happens with software is the reason I enjoy programming and
why I choose to follow the UNIX philosophy. It also describes how I feel about
successful relationships, and in particular romantic ones.
