written to work for both without change.

Name
====
The name arose out of my mistaken belief in the existence of a phonetically
similar word, which I later discovered was "unison". That is, I believed that
"unisis" was word meaning something like 'a coordination between parts so that
they fulfill a purpose together which they could not have done alone.' The joy
I feel when this happens with software is the reason that I code and also why
I choose to follow the UNIX philosophy. It also describes how I feel about
successful relationships, and in particular romantic ones.
