Build
=====
There is no library but to build the unit tests you can simply type 'make'
or 'nmake' depending on your environment. The authored Makefile has been
written to work for both without change. To alter configurations for nmake
edit the standard Tools.ini file. For GNU make edit the Tools.gnu file.

Name
====
The name arose out of my mistaken belief in the existence of a phonetically
similar word, which I later discovered was "unison". That is, I believed that
"unisis" was a word meaning something like 'a coordination between many agents
without their prior spoken agreement to do so.' By replacing the later half
with 'sys' for the 'system' abbreviation I came up with the name of this code.
The meaning I ascibed to my imaginary word is also how I understand software
development and economic activity more broadly.
